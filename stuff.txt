Happy 19th Birthday Iman! I love you so much and I wanted to give you something directly from my heart for this special day. There's nothing more I love doing
than telling you how much you mean to me, except I decided to make it a little more than just a message. So here's a very special website letting you
know how amazing of a person you are and how happy I am to be your friend. Have fun exploring this little website I made just for you.
-Your Best Friend, Hafsah

I genuinely spent so long thinking of the perfect gift to give you and I know I had to give you something. I felt like this was
the best way to show how much I love you. You're truly the best friend ANYONE could ask for and I'm literally so honored to be 
your best friend. Like tbh I quite literally owe you my life atp. I hope you have an amazing birthday and this next year is filled with even more adventure in your life. I hope Allah keeps us together in this world and the hereafter, we better be Jannah neighbors fr fr Inshallah.
