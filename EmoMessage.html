              <p>Happy birthday Iman! We barely hung out at hira but we have grown so much as friends in the years since and I’m 
                so grateful for that! You’re literally so much fun and so so hard working and good at everything you do. Your reaction 
                to that sloth still makes me laugh tbh HAHAHA it was too cute. I pray our bond never breaks unlike Hafsah’s ribs &hearts; May Allah 
                bless you with many many many more birthdays and make every path you pursue full of barakah (and give you many more reunions w me)!!!!</p>

              <p>I genuinely spent so long thinking of the perfect gift to give you and 
                I know I had to give you something. I felt like this was the best way to show how much 
                I love you. You're truly the best friend ANYONE could ask for and I'm literally so honored to be 
                your best friend. Like tbh I quite literally owe you my life atp. I hope you have an amazing birthday 
                and that this next year is filled with even more adventure in your life. I hope Allah keeps us together in this
                 world and the hereafter, we better be Jannah neighbors fr fr Inshallah. </p>

                i still remember the very first day of Hira when i saw you while playing mafia and i instantly 
                thought you were so cool (you were wearing a vibrant blue hijab and it draped over your face so cutely).
                 you’re genuinely one of the funniest people i know and i love how our friendship has blossomed over the years. 
                 i hope you know how much i truly appreciate our friendship, and how comfortable & happy i feel anytime we talk. 
                 thank you for making my hira & alim experience amazing, and inshaAllah we meet at another retreat (or when i finally 
                 get traveling rights). i love you so much, may Allah always keep you happy and close to Him &hearts;
